# Project Template npm-typescript-rollup-template

Generator utilities that bring array-like operations like map, filter, slice, some, every, and more
to sync and async generators. Instead of producing arrays, these operations produce new generators.

Generators can be enhanced with new methods, or functional programming can be used to construct
operators on generators.
